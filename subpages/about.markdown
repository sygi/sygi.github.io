Jakub Sygnowski
==========

I used to be Research Engineer in [(Google) DeepMind](https://deepmind.com), and then in [poolside](https://poolside.ai/).

On this page I share summaries of some projects I did for fun, written down before jumping to the next exciting thing.

For information on most of my past work projects, you can see [my Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Iz9Z0sAAAAJ).

You can contact me by writing an email to `<my last name>@gmail.com`.
