<h1><a href="posts/2022-07-17-3d-landscapes.html">Environment design in Blender</a></h1>
<p>Recently, I got into creating 3D environments in Blender. While it involves a lot of artistic elements, there are some rules and workflows that make the process easier. I watched dozens of youtube tutorials about the topic and wrote down the lessons I learned in this post. Warning: this is a long read.</p>

<h1><a href="posts/2022-05-22-cloud-computing.html">Cloud computing</a></h1>
<p>In recent years, cloud computing became very popular: it is both used on single pages with CVs and governments’ apps worth hundreds of millions. As I wanted to publish online a couple of smaller projects, I played with a number of cloud-based services to see how easy to use and costly are they for a hobby project.</p>

<h1><a href="posts/2022-04-18-geometry-nodes.html">Geometry nodes</a></h1>
<p>Blender recently introduced a new way of manipulating 3D meshes: geometry nodes. It combines a standard node-based UI (similar to the one used for constructing materials) with a script-like expressiveness to control each vertex arbitrarily. I learned the basics of geometry nodes and did a simple project using the new mechanism to try them out.</p>

<p>To improve my 3d modeling skills in Blender, I made models for a set of chess pieces. Given their rotational symmetry, I constructed them as traces that Bézier curves leave when they are rotated around an axis.</p>

<h1><a href="posts/2022-03-13-customs.html">Historia jednej paczki</a></h1>
<p>Here goes a story of a package with private items that I sent before moving from Switzerland to Poland. One may be surprised that this mundane topic is granted a blogpost, but the story is filled with absurdities. As I am afraid they would not be understandable if I tried to express the drama in English, this post is exceptionally written in Polish.</p>

<h1><a href="posts/2021-12-01-pbr-materials.html">Physically-based rendering: materials</a></h1>
<p>3D scenes consist of objects, each of which has a shape and a material. The shape is defined through a mesh: a collection of vertices, edges, and faces living in a 3D world. The material describes the color of the object and how it reflects and transmits light. In this post, I inspect a popular way of expressing the material: a principled BSDF to see how its numerous parameters influence the look of an object.</p>

<h1><a href="posts/2021-11-28-pbr-101.html">Physically-based rendering 101</a></h1>
<p>After watching one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg">Two minute papers</a> videos: a short video summary of a research paper made by ‪Károly Zsolnai-Fehér‬, YouTube algorithm suggested I should watch <a href="https://users.cg.tuwien.ac.at/zsolnai/gfx/rendering-course/">the rendering course</a> of the same author next. My physically-based rendering knowledge is very fragmented: I was immersed in the lingo without understanding it through friends who are doing PhDs in related areas, and I tried and failed to read <a href="https://pbr-book.org">PBRT</a>. I watched Károly’s course to connect the dots and, hopefully, to understand Blender better.</p>

<h1><a href="posts/2021-10-27-tts.html">Easy-to-use text-to-speech</a></h1>
<p>Adventure games, the genre I like, tend to contain a lot of talking. Apart from writing the character statements on the screen, bigger game studios hire voice actors to record them and play the recordings. It is a lengthy and costly process. I decided to see how far text-to-speech is from being able to substitute human actors for indie adventure games.</p>

<h1><a href="posts/2021-10-22-blender.html">Learning Blender</a></h1>
<p>When I was doing the graphics for the T.I.M.E stories expansion, I tried out various workflows for creating the content. Looking for inspiration on how professionals make art faster, I encountered a GDC talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYbYvImd7Bw&amp;ab_channel=GDC">Concept Art is Dead</a>. It claimed that no one is drawing things from scratch and everyone uses quick shortcuts like rendering a scene in Blender to get nice shadows or copying the texture from the internet instead. I tried it out to see how learning the basics of Blender may help me in creating 2D graphics.</p>

<p>At the end of last year, I made a fan <a href="../posts/2020-12-07-auschwitz.html">time stories scenario</a>. Concretely, only the “story” part was finished then, with all the graphics missing. This year, together with Michalina, I was working on and off on adding the custom images to the game. Being relatively new to graphic design, I tried a couple of different styles and workflows for creating the content.</p>
