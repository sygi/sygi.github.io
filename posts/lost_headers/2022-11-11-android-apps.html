<p>Mobile devices currently generate <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">most of the traffic</a> on the Internet, with Android <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide">being the most popular</a> mobile operating system. I find it amazing that the whole ecosystem is open, and one can write applications for everyone with free tools. While I donâ€™t write mobile apps professionally anymore, I still occasionally create small programs for personal use.</p>
