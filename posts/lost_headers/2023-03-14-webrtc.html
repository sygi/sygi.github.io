<p>The internet typically relies on a client-server model, where a server hosts websites or applications, and users access them through their devices. However, this model may not be suitable for certain functions, such as file sharing or video calls. Thatâ€™s where peer-to-peer communication comes in, enabling users to directly connect and communicate without a server. To make building peer-to-peer applications easier, developers created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> protocol.</p>
