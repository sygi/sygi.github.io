<h1>Digital painting exercises</h1>
<p>I think I am learning the quickest when doing a sequence of well-defined challenges of appropriate difficulty. As I didn’t find a course of digital drawing I’d like to follow, I was compiling separate exercises from various sources. They helped me to make small steps of progress in improving my digital painting skills.</p>
<h2 id="drawing-people">Drawing people</h2>
<p>For a start, I decided to revisit Proko lessons and learn to better draw people on a tablet.</p>
<h3 id="line-of-action-developing-workflow">Line of Action, developing workflow</h3>
<p>A popular exercise when learning to draw people is the timed drawing, where students draw a model in a short, predefined period of time. The goal is to be able to concentrate on capturing general gesture as opposed to details.</p>
<p>Many websites help to run a similar exercise online, where the student is drawing from a prepared picture which changes every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>I was using two websites for this: <a href="https://line-of-action.com">Line of Action</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCliUF1c8m7MUspaCykJljSg">New Masters Academy</a> channel on Youtube. They both have lots of content to draw.</p>
<p>You can see the effects of my experimentation below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After doing these drawings, I have developed a workflow that seems to work well for me:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I start with a quick gesture line</li>
<li>Then, on another layer, I draw basic shapes on top to get all body parts in place.</li>
<li>Finally, I draw a contour line with a slightly smoothing pen on the final layer.</li>
</ol>

<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>Before moving on to the next thing, I made a couple of drawings following the workflow below:</p>
<figure>
<a href="../images/digital_painting2/people/final/A.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/digital_painting2/people/final/A.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="Human drawing" /><img data-bilderrahmen="people" /></a>
<figcaption>

</figure>
<h3 id="portrait-painting">Portrait painting</h3>
<p>In the poses drawings, I omitted hands, feet, and faces, as they are harder than the overall shape of the body and a topic on their own. I decided to spend a bit of time learning to draw heads, though.</p>
<p>Initially, I did two sketches using the same reference page as before:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/digital_painting2/people/Heads.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="Sketches of a head." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sketches of a head.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I then moved to digital painting. I started by following <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDd22s3jec">the walkthrough</a> on a Sam Does Arts youtube channel:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/digital_painting2/people/Sam.png" style="width:45.0%" alt="Portrait painting based on a tutorial." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Portrait painting based on a tutorial.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While not everything here looks great, I think the overall shapes and colors went fine.</p>
<p>Then, I tried to paint my girlfriend from a photo. To decrease the number of things to think about, I allowed myself to trace the picture to establish the initial shapes. Somehow, they still didn’t end up as well as they should, which created an opportunity to learn the <a href="https://procreate.art/handbook/procreate/adjustments/adjustments-liquify/">liquify tool</a>, which allows to smoothly shrink and stretch elements of the picture.</p>
<p>Another element that didn’t work well in this picture is the saturation of colors. While one would usually see less saturation in strongly-lit areas, as the skin has red stuff beneath it, you can see more vibrant colors in lighted areas than in neutral light (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering">subsurface scattering</a>). The shadows also ended up too grey, looking too much like dirt.</p>

<h2 id="art-studies">Art studies</h2>
<p>I found online a suggestion for improving one’s art: to analyze the paintings of others or movie frames. I decided to try two methods: a value and a color study.</p>
<h3 id="value-studies">Value studies</h3>
<p>Value (lightness) is a primary tool for creating a contrast in a picture. To think about how others use values in their art, I followed an exercise to draw using only three colors: white, black, and grey. Initially, the areas that light reaches are covered with white, then the half-tone ones are getting changed to grey. Arguably, this exercise helps to understand the shape of the objects in the pictures.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/digital_painting2/analysis/values.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="Value study of a couple of paintings and movie frames." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Value study of a couple of paintings and movie frames.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="color-studies">Color studies</h3>
<p>The other exercise I tried was a more holistic analysis of the pictures of others. I looked over a couple of them and tried to understand the techniques used and reproduce them in a simplified form.</p>
<p>I used pictures of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0XHwYwoeWJC9d0ndtev5vw">AngryMikko</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsDxB-CSMQ0Vu_hTag7-2UQ">Marco Bucci</a> for this, whose colors (despite having different styles) I enjoy.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main observation from Mikko was that, although his pictures feel colorful, he’s only using high saturation in a small portion of them: most of the time, he uses the saturation lower than 50%.</p>
<figure>
<a href="../images/digital_painting2/analysis/bucci.png"><img src="../images/digital_painting2/analysis/bucci.png" style="width:65.0%" alt="Tree character" /></a>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the other hand, Marco uses more highly-saturated areas. He also uses a bunch of different brushes compared to Mikko. It seems that, as the character was the main focus, its high value/saturation looks good even though it should be more in shadow behind the tree.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Apart from studying others’ work, I also did a couple of custom exercises.</p>
<h3 id="lightning-a-cube">Lightning a cube</h3>
<p>First, after watching a couple of tutorials about color theory (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcCJ2CU-bFw">Light and shadow</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwLQ0cDb4cE">Understanding shadow colors</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=botKNa3YGsI">Cavemen color theory</a>), I decided to summarize the general ideas behind natural colors of areas in light and shadow.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="rocks">Rocks</h3>
<p>Then, I decided to put it into practice a bit more and tried drawing rocks. I partially followed the tutorials (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-7XzBg1wPM">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puTpnQRKzUQ">2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFB9FE18POY&amp;t=252s&amp;ab_channel=WalidFeghali">3</a>), and partially tried to imagine the shapes on my own and confirm my understanding of lightning on a rock.</p>

<h3 id="glowing-stuff">Glowing stuff</h3>
<p>Then, I tried to learn how to draw glowing things, as I find them to look cool. I decided to draw a picture of a turtle in a dark forest with some symbols glowing on its shell.</p>
<figure>
<a href="../images/digital_painting2/exercises/Turtle.png"><img src="../images/digital_painting2/exercises/Turtle.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="Turtle painting" /></a>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It turned out that the glowing letters were surprisingly simple to do; for this, I followed the advice of using multiple layers with more and more blurred images.</p>
<p>However, the overall image turned out so-so. I think these were the main problems:</p>
<p>I didn’t plan the composition/focal point/values upfront. The initial idea was to have a bigger view with a horizon line and fancy lights, but I decided to cut the complexity and concentrate on the turtle.</p>
<p>Even with a reduced view, I think there is too much area on the picture where nothing happens. I should have tried to put more contrasting elements around.</p>
<p>Apart from this, it seems I took Mikko’s example too much to heart and used saturated colors too little. I tried to fix it in the post-process, which only helped to some extent.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I did a few exercises to improve my use of colors and ability to draw people. While I still envy colorful landscapes and would like to learn how to paint them, I think that I like more the style of strong lines and simple, close to flat colors (more <em>drawing</em> than <em>painting</em>).</p>
